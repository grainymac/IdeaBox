### Project Description

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/ideabox-group-v2.html). The deployment page can be found [here](https://jmyacobn.github.io/IdeaBox/). Video of web application [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ckjKInJhY).

### Learning Goals

* Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### Technologies Used

* Atom
* HTML
* CSS
* Chrome Dev Tools
* JavaScript
* Github

### Set-up

* In your terminal, create a direcotry called `IdeaBox`.
* Initialize git in the local repo by `git init`.
* Create three files name `main.js`, `index.html`, `Idea.js`, and `style.css`.
* Push local repo to remote repo on GitHub, using `git push origin main`.
* Rest of tean clones repo using `git clone`.

### Wins

* Deepened our understanding of reading and writing code by manipulating the DOM with the data model and refactoring
* Debugged the issues that arose when starring a button by indendent research, utilizing console logs, and Chrome Dev Tools
* Followed the DTR by respectfully commuicating and listening to each as we worked through the project collaboratively

### Challenges

* Updating the DOM with the data model
* Filtering the favorite idea cards
* Using CSS to create a webpage that is responsive to multiple screen sizes

### Future Features

* When user clicks on "filter starred ideas", page only shows favorited ideas. 
* When user clicks on all ideas, page switches back to showing all Ideas.
* When a user types in the search bar, idea cards filter to show which card contains those letters. 
* Create a more interactive and dynamic CSS.
* Add a comment function to the idea cards to expand on the data model.

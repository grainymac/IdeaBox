### Project Description

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/ideabox-group-v2.html). The deployment page can be found [here](https://jmyacobn.github.io/IdeaBox/). Video of web application [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ckjKInJhY).

### Learning Goals

* Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### Technologies Used

* Atom
* HTML
* CSS
* Chrome Dev Tools
* JavaScript
* Github

### Set-up

* one person create a directory called ideabox.  initialize the git in the local repo.  
* push local repo to remote repo on GitHub.  rest of tean clones repo.


### Wins

* Deepened our understanding of reading and writting code. How to manipulate the DOM with the data model. Refactoring.
* Debugging iteration 3.
* Commuicating, listening, and working together.  Following the DTR

### Challenges

* Updating the DOM with the data model.
* Filtering the favorite idea cards.
* affecting the CSS to where the size of our application was dynamic.

### Future Features

* Iteration 4
* More interactive/dynamic CSS
* expand on the data model concept by adding a comment function to the idea cards.
